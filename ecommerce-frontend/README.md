# Ecommerce Frontend

This is a minimal React (Vite) frontend for the Syntecxhub e-commerce project.

Quick start:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_API_URL` to your backend (e.g. `http://localhost:5000/api`).
2. Install dependencies and run dev server:

```powershell
cd ecommerce-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs on http://localhost:3000 and talks to the backend API for products, auth, cart and checkout.
